# nlp_with_tensorflow-keras

<h3> Sentiment Analysis </h3>

<h4> Why I did this? </h4>
<p> I only learnt machine learning algorithms but I wanted to step up and learn deep learning. </br> 
    I originally started with tensorflow version 1, but then came to know keras is better and is easy to use with same features. </br>  
    This repo is just I trying to learn keras by building NLP model using Twitter data. </br>
    </p>
    
<h4> Content </h4>  
<p> review </br>- Data is about phone reviews. </br> 
                - review_prepare has data preparation step. </br>   
                - review_tf has modelling. </br>
                </p>
                
<p> twitter </br> - Twitter data </br> 
                  - Tried mutilple models </br> 
                  </p>
            
<p> twitter_sxsw </br> - Twitter data about South by South West tweets </br> 
                  - Tried mutilple models </br> 
                  </p>           

<h5> In above projects (except for sxsw) models were tested with dummy statements to check for the performace (closer to 0 is bad and closer to 1 is good sentiment). </br>
     And .tsv files are generated to load them in tensorflow embdedding project to visualize the words in 3D space.
